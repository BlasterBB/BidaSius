BidaSius

I'm training ISSF 10m air pistol and i train at home - so mostly after 10shots i had to go 10m and change paper target. It was wrong:) <br>
So i've created this :) <br>
Its not preety but its cheap and it works.<br>
Total cost i would say is around 200PLN which is like 50$.<br>
All you need is : <br>
1 good usb camera<br>
1 computer<br>
1 10m usb cable <br>
1 used/dead ink printer<br>
1 arduino<br>
power source<br>
usb hub<br>
maybe 3d printer for camera mount print - mine its crap<br>
some electronic and mechanical skills <br>



I have no time to develop it further ... maybe some of you will :) <br>
If somebody has some questions please let me know , feel free to use it privately <br>
Of course everything is in Polish :) <br>

Details: <br>
It uses webcam => grabs images => process them(with emgucv library) => show result on screen => scroll paper on target => repeat<br>

It can use any black paper roll even packing paper - but best one is kruger... <br>

About processing library ... i completly dont know  anything about image procesing .... so it was all done by trial and error method<br>
